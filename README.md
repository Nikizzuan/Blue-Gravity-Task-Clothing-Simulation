I am currently working on the project assessment as described below. The full document can be found in the `assert/Document` folder.

### Introduction

I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this programming interview task. This assignment is to be completed within 48 hours, allowing for a fair evaluation of all candidates. If an extension is needed, I will notify in advance, understanding that the assessment considers development time.

### Task Overview

- **Project Requirements:**
  - Develop a 2D clothes shop simulation game reminiscent of 'The Sims' and 'Stardew Valley.'
  - The player character should be able to walk and interact with the game world.
  - The project must be developed using Unity version 2022.3.25.f1.

- **Features to Implement:**

  2. Buying and selling items
  3. Displaying item icons and prices
  4. Equipping purchased outfits, which should be visible on the character

- **Design and Aesthetics:**
  - Design a suitable UI for the prototype.
  - Utilize pre-made art assets or create my own.

- **Development Guidelines:**
  - Use GitHub for version control, making incremental commits during development.
  - Provide a public GitHub link for easy access and playtesting.
  - Send a zipped copy of the executable (.exe) file to the specified email with the name format '**YOUR NAME_BGS TASK**'.
  - Create a 300-word document explaining the system, my thought process, and a personal assessment of my performance, and attach this as a PDF on GitHub.

- **Quality Expectations:**
  - Ensure high quality in design, aesthetics, and playability.
  - Thoroughly playtest the game before submission.


Thank you for this opportunity. I am excited to demonstrate my skills and dedication through this task.
